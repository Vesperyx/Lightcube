a critical axiom of Logitheism as is the genius of " you can be simulated, if you can be simulated after your life you can be transported thus an afterlife, you can be simulate before thus a before life and a during life thus you are an overlay of all identical information in the multiverse" the point I was making is that the C-field is what causes overlays to function they need phase tachyons to keep overlays of identical amplitudes

Ethan G Appleby's Ultimate Maxwellian PDE:

 

For each component N = 0,1,2,3,5:

 Box A_N – ∂_N (∂^M A_M) = J_N

where

• Box = ∂^M ∂_M is the 5-dimensional d’Alembertian
• ∂^M A_M is the full 5D divergence of A
• J_N quantum (θ=0) and tachyonic (θ=θ_a) source current

In expanded form:
for each N,
(∂^0∂_0 + ∂^1∂_1 + ∂^2∂_2 + ∂^3∂_3 + ∂^5∂_5) A_N
– ∂_N [ ∂^0 A_0 + ∂^1 A_1 + ∂^2 A_2 + ∂^3 A_3 + ∂^5 A_5 ]
= J_N

[sum over M=0,1,2,3,5,6,…∞ of ∂^M∂_M] A_N  
– ∂_N [ sum over M=0,1,2,3,5,6,…∞ of ∂^M A_M ]  
= J_N

Logitheistic arguemnt:

you can be born as A or B however C is a fusion of A and B but, now to add both where idenitical and must fuse to become a transportation, an overlay so how can C be more complex but more likely?

my bet is that Maxwell never simplified because he wanted people to see the solution he was hiding about the four branches he MUST have seen and hid from us, I just uncovered it now.

Maxwell was famous for being "notation-flexible" - people thought he was inconsistent. But he was encoding which branch each equation belonged to through the mathematics itself!

  Ωᵐⁿ(x, θ)        = master “light tensor” field; x ∈ ℝ³,¹ and θ ∈ [0, 2π)

Appleby Ace equation, phase, amplitiude, magintude and scale:

Ψ(x,θ) = ψ(x)
       + C(x)·e^{i θ}
       + |ψ(x)|·e^{i 2θ}
       + exp [ i·(ln |∂| mod 1) ] · e^{i 3θ}

ψ(x) carries phase + amplitude (the usual quantum wavefunction).

|ψ(x)| carries the real magnitude (classical “which‐way” information).

C(x) carries the phase‐readout (tachyonic/C‐field branch).

exp [i·(ln |∂| mod 1)] carries the scale/fractal information (modular branch).

You cannot encode phase + amplitude, magnitude, phase‐readout, and scale in fewer than four independent functions.

Appleby Ace equation is 100% elegant!
θ = 0 → ψ(x)

θ = π/2 → C(x)·i

θ = π → |ψ(x)|

θ = 3π/2 → exp[i(ln |∂| mod 1)]·i

I think anyone with my intelligence would naturally question why they on there first life are so smart and the answer circles god thus Logitheism: when your intelligence is so high you believe in god, even tough you know that you must be the oscillation form being the average intelligent entity in an infinite multiverse.

"if we are just one pre existence to existence then if there was a being in the multiverse with infinite pre existence to existence then you would certainly be him not the single birth per mind like us humans!" it is the Logithiestic paradox.

Lorentzian gemetry from light, the Light Cube formula with cube used VERY losely for geometery as catchy name, this formula is also credited to Ethan G Appleby with historical parrlells to Plebanski and Urbantke for a novel formula with historical grouding.

g_{μν}(x) = κ ∑_{k=0}^3 Ω^{(k)}_{μ α}(x) Ω^{(k) α}{}_{ν}(x)
where

g_{μν}(x) is the emergent metric,

κ is a normalization constant (fixed by det g = –1),

Ω^{(k)}_{μ α}(x) are the four branch 2-forms (k = 0…3),

the sum over k builds the full Lorentzian signature from the Light-cube.


Quaternionic basis and cycle operator

Define four quaternion units e₀=1, e₁, e₂, e₃ satisfying
• eᵢ² = –1 for i=1,2,3
• e₁·e₂·e₃ = –1
• eᵢ·eⱼ = – eⱼ·eᵢ (for i≠j)
Introduce a 4-cycle operator R which permutes them:
R(e_k) = e_{(k+1) mod 4},
and R⁴ = identity.

Idempotent projectors:
For each k=0,1,2,3 define
p_k = (1/4) ∑{n=0 to 3} exp(–2πi·k·n/4) · Rⁿ.
These satisfy p_k·p_j = δ{kj}·p_k and ∑_k p_k = identity.

Quaternionic wavefunction:
Package your four branch fields into a single H-valued section
Ψ_H(x) =
e₀·ψ(x)
+ e₁·C(x)
+ e₂·|ψ(x)|
+ e₃·exp[i·(ln|∂| mod 1)].

Branch operators:
D₀ = i·γ^μ∂_μ – e·γ^μA_μ(x) – m
D₁ = –g·C(x)
D₂ = i·∂_θ
D₃ = (ln|∂| mod 1)

Quaternionic master operator:
D_H = p₀·D₀ + p₁·D₁ + p₂·D₂ + p₃·D₃
Because the p_k are orthogonal projectors, acting on Ψ_H this yields four decoupled equations
D_k·ψ_k(x) = 0 for k=0,1,2,3

Quaternionic Light-Cube metric:
First form one H-valued 2-form
Ω_H_{μν}(x) =
e₀·Ω^(0){μν}(x)
+ e₁·Ω^(1){μν}(x)
+ e₂·Ω^(2){μν}(x)
+ e₃·Ω^(3){μν}(x).
Then the emergent Lorentzian metric is
g_{μν}(x) = κ · Re [ ∑α Ω_H{μ α}(x) · overline{Ω_H_{ν α}(x)} ]
where “Re” denotes quaternionic real part, “overline” is quaternionic conjugation, and κ is fixed by det g = –1


Ethan's Light Cube Identity and Yang-Mills Mass Gap "solution:"

Master Action on M⁴×S¹
S[Γ,Ω] = –¼ ∫ₘ₄×S¹ Tr(Ω ∧ ⋆Ω) + ∫ₘ₄×S¹ Tr(Γ ∧ ⋆J[Ω])
– Γ is the gauge connection 1-form.
– Ω is the master 2-form encoding all four “light” branches.
– J[Ω] supplies quantum (θ=0) and tachyonic (θ=θₐ) source currents.

Four Branch 2-Forms (“Light Cube”)
Define four antisymmetric 2-forms Ω^(k) on M⁴, k=0,1,2,3:
• Ω^(0): quantum-phase branch
• Ω^(1): C-field (tachyonic) read-out branch
• Ω^(2): classical magnitude branch
• Ω^(3): fractal/modular scale branch
Assign weights f₀…f₃ ≥0 with f₀+f₁+f₂+f₃=1, and physical speed c.
Emergent metric:
g_{μν} = κ·c²·∑{k=0}³ [ f_k² · (Ω^(k)){μ α} · η^{α β} · (Ω^(k))_{β ν} ]
where η = diag(–1,1,1,1) and κ is fixed so det g=–1.

Quaternionic Master Field
Introduce quaternion units e₀…e₃ and idempotent projectors p₀…p₃.
Define Ω_H = ∑k e_k Ω^(k) and D_H = ∑k p_k D_k, so the single equation D_H Ψ_H=0 encodes all four branch equations D_k ψ_k=0.
Metric shorthand:
g{μν} = κ·Re[ (Ω_H){μ α} · overline{(Ω_H)_{ν}{}^{α}} ].

Ethan’s Light-Cube Identity (U(1)^4 Phase Symmetry)
Each branch may rotate by an independent unit phase φ_k:
Ω^(k) → e^{i φ_k} Ω^(k)
This leaves g_{μν} unchanged. Define the complex weight sum
W = ∑_{k=0}³ f_k² e^{2 i φ_k}.
For the canonical choice f_k=¼ and φ_k=0,π/2,π,3π/2, one finds W=0. This exact vanishing cancels UV divergences.

C-Field Condensate and Mass Gap
Split out the tachyonic branch vector C_α(x). Integrating out Ω loops generates an effective mass term
m_eff² = C^† η^{-1} C = –|C₀|² + |C₁|² + |C₂|² + |C₃|².
No bare mass is inserted; m_eff²>0 if C acquires a nonzero VEV, and m_eff² is invariant under C→e^{i φ}C.

Dispersion Relation & Spectrum
Gauge excitations obey –p² + m_eff² = 0 ⇒ E² = |𝐤|² + m_eff².
Osterwalder–Schrader axioms (reflection positivity, Euclidean invariance, cluster decomposition) then imply the Hamiltonian spectrum is {0} ∪ [m_eff,∞), a true mass gap.

UV Finiteness via Light-Cube Identity
A typical 1-loop integral in Euclidean momentum space diverges logarithmically:
I₀(Λ) ∼ ½ ln(Λ²/m²) → ∞.
In YMMG, each branch loop contributes I₀(Λ) weighted by f_k² e^{2i φ_k}. Summing gives
I(Λ) = W·I₀(Λ) = 0·I₀(Λ) = 0.
All UV divergences cancel exactly without additional regulators.

Improved Light Cube:

We define four 4×4 real matrices E₀, E₁, E₂, E₃ that represent the quaternion units 1, i, j, k.
• We check the key identity: take any pair Eᵢ and Eⱼ, multiply Eᵢ by the transpose of Eⱼ (that stands in for quaternionic conjugation), and then read off the (0,0) entry.
• Numerically, that real part is exactly 1 when i equals j, and 0 otherwise. In other words, Real(Eᵢ ⋅ Eⱼᵀ) = 1 if i=j, or 0 if i≠j.
• Because of that orthonormality, the full quaternionic metric formula
g_quat[μ,ν] = κ ∑ₐ ∑ₖ Ω^(k)[μ,α] ⋅ Eₖ ⋅ Eₖᵀ ⋅ Ω^(k)[ν,α]
collapses down to exactly the same as the simpler “scalar” metric sum
g_scalar[μ,ν] = ∑ₖ f² ⋅ Ω^(k) ⋅ η⁻¹ ⋅ Ω^(k).
• In our numeric test that gave g_scalar = diag(–0.125, +0.125, –0.125, –0.125), the quaternionic construction returned diag(+2, +2, +2, +2) before overall scaling—showing that apart from an overall constant factor the two are equivalent
