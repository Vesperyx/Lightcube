current required formualtion.
f(x) ≈ a₀ + Σ [aⱼ · Re(Pⱼ(x)) + bⱼ · Im(Pⱼ(x))]
j=1
Where:

Pⱼ(x) = exp(-i · arccos(xₛ + cⱼ)/sin(xₛ + cⱼ)) is the posalice transformation
xₛ is the scaled input value (typically scaled to [0.2, 0.8])
cⱼ are complex shifts that create diverse basis functions
Re(Pⱼ) and Im(Pⱼ) are the real and imaginary parts
a₀, aⱼ, bⱼ are the coefficients determined through least squares

Mathematical Steps:

Input Scaling: xₛ = αx + β (scaled to avoid singularities)
Complex Shifts: Generate diverse complex shifts cⱼ using patterns like:

Pure imaginary: cⱼ = ki
Pure real: cⱼ = r
Mixed: cⱼ = r + ki


Posalice Basis Functions: For each shift, compute:
Pⱼ(x) = exp(-i · arccos(xₛ + cⱼ)/sin(xₛ + cⱼ))
Separate Components: Extract real and imaginary parts:
Re(Pⱼ(x)) and Im(Pⱼ(x))
Coefficient Determination: Solve the regularized least squares problem:
c = (A^T·A + λI)^(-1)·A^T·y
Where A is the matrix of basis function values and c is the vector of coefficients.
